# Ungrad Labenter

A Plugin to simplify the task of entering lab values manually.

Background: Most lab devices in medical practices can send their results automatically to Elexis. But not all practices do connect all their devices directly. Sometimes, it's just not practical, sometimes, it would be to expensive, some times, there even doesn't exist an adapter for Elexis. In such cases, entering lab values was quite tedious.

Now it's simple:

* Define the lab results in Preferences->Laboreingabe. Klick "New.." to see a list af alle lab items defined in the system and pick one by one those you need to enter manually. Then you can order them as you like.

* Open the view Messungen/Laboreingabe and you'll see the formerly defined items. Now just enter the values, use the tab key to save and go to the next item. As you finished (or any time) select the corresponding patient and the correct date and click the "save" toolbar button.


## Notes

All entered results are only saved after click on the "save" button. They are assigned to the patient who was selected when clicking the "save" button. 

This Feature works with Elexis Ungrad 2018. It should also work with Elexis OpenSource 3.4.
